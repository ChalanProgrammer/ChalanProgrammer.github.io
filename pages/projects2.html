        <p class="project_paragraph">I programmed this in my first few months of learning Python. It is a very beginning program, but it is cool nonetheless. It is just a very simple Rock Paper Scissors game. I included it here because I was very impressed with myself when I created this. And I remember the struggle of trying to create it but feeling so good when I did finally finish.<br><br> This is the link to my game!<br><a href="https://codehs.com/sandbox/id/rock-paper-scissors-iLFWgG" target="_blank">Rock Paper Scissors Game</a></p>
