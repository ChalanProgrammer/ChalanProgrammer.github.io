        <p id="project_paragraph">The first project I did was for Byte Jam. Byte Jam is a event held by my local college to encourage kids who know how to program. To join a competition where they judge your teams program. In my Sophomore year of highschool, my team and I created a website to fill the theme "90's". It is pretty much a arcade room, but when you click on the arcade machine it takes you into an era of the 90's.</p>
