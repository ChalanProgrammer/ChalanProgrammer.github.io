                <h3 id="paragraph1">Hello, my name is Chalan Zugg. I have had a passion for anything electronic since I was a child. For example, when I played video games I would always ask “What makes this work”. I would research these things but come up empty-handed. Until I turned 16 when I began learning how to program HTML, CSS, and Python. I have programmed a multitude of programs since then, including this very website.</h3> 
                <h3 id="paragraph2">In my first year of coding in high school, I finished the year off with a 104%. I love coding, and I pour my heart and soul into every program I create. I also pour my heart into school, My grades scarcely drop below a 4.0. My GPA has been 3.96 for years. At this very moment, I am in my Junior year of high school and I am already taking college classes!</h3>
